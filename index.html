               Amnesia Bar was the main project for the subject "Databases". It
               is a single tier Java desktop application made using the library

            <p>
               Book In Pop Out was the main project for the subject "Data
               Structures". It is a three tier Java application using a mobile
               client (made with Java, for Android) as frontend, Java servlets
               as backend, and MySQL for the database. It allows clients the
               creation of virtual "priority queues" for the services that
               require them, avoiding agglomerations of people in large queues
               waiting to be attended. Besides, it uses concurrency to handle
               each client's turn. Here are the links to the Github repositories
               for the

            <h4>Explora Projects</h4>
            <p>
               Explora Projects was my first React project, which I made to
               allow my classmates of the subject "Explora Intensive English",
               the upload of the projects (a set of articles) we made for the
               course. I coded it using React class components. At that time I
               did not have knowledge of backend technologies. Therefore, I
               chose Firebase to make the authentication, used its real-time
               database to store the users and the posts/projects and to host
               the app.
               <br /><br />

            <h4>CronosUN</h4>
            <p>
               CronosUN is a web application that originally started as the main
               project for the subject "Software Engineering I". This project
               was developed by a team of five people following some software
               engineering practices. We began planning the requirements for the
               project (60 was the goal), creating the use cases based on them,
               and then we started its development with the SCRUM methodology,
               with three sprints, two of them being completed. <br />
               <br />
               Aditionally, while making the project we learned about Spring
               Boot, making a REST API (using MySQL as the database), and we
               also learned how to make the authentication between the frontend
               (made with React.js) and the backend. Regarding the frontent, we
               decided to try Sass and React with Hooks to reduce and modularize
               the codebase. Here are the links of the Github repositories for
               the
               <a

               Social network fullstack application developed among five CS students, with me as the scrum master and
               one of the core developers. We have taken special care for the architecture, adopting the principles of
               the Clean Architecture. Moreover, we apply BDD to validate our use cases, and we strongly focus on 
               implementing good security practices.
               Soon it will be deployed and ready for use.
